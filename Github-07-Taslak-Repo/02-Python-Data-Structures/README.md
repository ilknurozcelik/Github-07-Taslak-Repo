# 02-Python-Data-Structures

Almost every program uses data. Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications. `Data Structures` allow you to store and manage your data.[^1]

Python has a number of `built-in` data structures:
01. [x] [01-Strings](01-Strings)
02. [x] [02-Lists](02-Lists)
03. [x] [03-Tuples](03-Tuples)
04. [x] [04-Sets](04-Sets)
05. [x] [05-Dictionaries](05-Dictionaries)
06. [x] [06-User-Defined-Data-Structures](06-User-Defined-Data-Structures)
